# Advanced CSS and SASS

A created this **modern responsive website** as a part of an online course created and designed by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.

I used the **7-1 rule**, component-based design and the **BEM methodology** to write **reusable**, **maintainable** and **scalable** code. 
The compilation, concatenation and compressing of the files are done using **NPM**.
